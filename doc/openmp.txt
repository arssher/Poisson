OpenMP:

# pragma omp parallel -- create a team of threads
# pragma omp for -- share loop, by default static schedule.
# Note that counters must be declared as private if not defined inline
# variables are shared between threads by default; mark it as a private
# to create a copy for each thread.

collapse allows sharing of nested loops

sections -- execute one section by one thread, order of sections not defined

reductions is a handy and fast mix of private, shared atomic clauses.
